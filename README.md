# Customer-Attrition-Predictive Model
Customer attrition/churning is the loss of customers by a business. 

It is a considerable concern in service sectors with high competitive services. 
Most customers of a given business will not remain active customers indefinitely.  It is a given fact that as the market grows, so does competition. Businesses typically treat a customer as churned once a particular amount of time has elapsed since the customer’s last interaction with the firm’s product. The full cost of attrition includes both lost revenue and the marketing costs involved with replacing those customers with new ones.

The ability to predict that a particular customer is at a high risk of churning while there is still time to do something about it, represents a huge additional potential revenue source for every business.
